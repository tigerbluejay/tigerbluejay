## Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

<p align="left">
This repositories hub showcases my work as a .NET software developer, with a focus on real-world full-stack projects, backend development, and algorithmic problem solving. You'll find C#/.NET Core APIs, Angular frontends, and SQL-based solutions that reflect both production-grade patterns and personal experimentation.
</p>

<p align="left">
Many of the repositories here serve as technical deep-dives, hands-on learning exercises, or interview preparation. I also share smaller utilities, patterns, and solutions that I've found useful in day-to-day development. Whether you're here to explore my code or get a sense of how I think through problems, thanks for stopping by!
